# Image-Classification-with-PyTorch
Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset.

1. Plot the learning curves and the accuracy of classification versus the number of epochs until convergence for training data as well as test data.  
2. Repeat 1 with different batch sizes.
3. Repeat 1 with different learning rates  
4. Randomly choose 10 images from your testing data and use model to predict their class.
